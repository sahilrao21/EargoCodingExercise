# Setup
1. Download Java if you don't have it (https://java.com/en/)
2. Clone this repository
4. Navigate to EargoCodingExercise/src
5. Run the following code below: <br>
export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:../lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:../lib/hamcrest-2.2.jar
javac main/\*.java test/\*.java  

# Coin Change
1. Navigate to EargoCodingExercise/src
2. Run: java main.CoinChange
3. The code is already setup such that the main method will run all of my tests. There should be information printed about each test, as well as an overall performance summary.
4. If you would like to view the code, navigate to main/CoinChange.java
5. If you would like to add more test cases, navigate to test/TestCoinChange.java and copy the format of the tests I made.

# Stock Simulation
1. Navigate to EargoCodingExercise/src
2. Run: java main.StockSimulation
3. The code is already setup such that the main method will run all of my tests. There should be information printed about each test, as well as an overall performance summary.
4. If you would like to view the code, navigate to main/StockSimulation.java
5. If you would like to add more test cases, navigate to test/TestStockSimulation.java and copy the format of the tests I made.

# SQL Aggregation Question
My SQL code can be found at: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/19053/6

# Miscellaneous
NOTE: Anytime you make a change to the code, you will need to re-run the following lines:<br/>
javac main/\*.java test/\*.java <br/>
java main.CoinChange or java main.StockSimulation

Please let me know if you have any questions or have any issues running my code!
